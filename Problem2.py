#I created an iterator that allows for skipping specific values while iterating through a given sequence. The class initializes with an iterator and maintains a dictionary, skip_counts, to track how many times each value should be skipped. The _prepare_next method advances the iterator to find the next valid element that is not in the skip list, updating next_val accordingly. The hasNext method checks if there are more elements to iterate over, while the next method retrieves the current value and prepares for the next element. The skip method adds values to the skip_counts dictionary, increasing their skip count and immediately skipping the current next_val if it matches the skipped value. The time complexity of next and skip operations is O(1) on average, due to efficient dictionary operations, while the _prepare_next method runs in O(k) where k is the number of skipped values until a valid element is found. The space complexity is O(n+k), where n is the number of elements in the iterator and k is the number of unique values in the skip list.
